**Abstract**: RPG is a powerful training-free paradigm that can utilize proprietary MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini-Pro) or open-source local MLLMs (e.g., miniGPT-4) as the **prompt recaptioner and region planner** with our **complementary regional diffusion** to achieve SOTA text-to-image generation and editing. Our framework is very flexible and can generalize to arbitrary MLLM architectures and diffusion backbones. RPG is also capable of generating image with super high resolutions, here is an example:

<table class="center">
    <tr>
    <td width=100% style="border: none"><img src="__asset__/demo/object/icefire.png" style="width:100%"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td width="100%" style="border: none; text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word">Text prompt: A beautiful landscape with a river in the middle the left of the river is in the evening and in the winter with a big iceberg and a small village while some people are skating on the river and some people are skiing, the right of the river is in the summer with a volcano in the morning and a small village while some people are playing.

## Preparations

**1. Set Environment**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YangLing0818/RPG-DiffusionMaster
cd RPG-DiffusionMaster
conda create -n RPG python==3.9
conda activate RPG
pip install -r requirements.txt
mkdir repositories
mkdir -p generated_imgs/demo_imgs
mkdir models/Stable-diffusion
```

**2. Download Libraries**
```bash
cd repositories
git clone https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models
git clone https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion
git clone https://github.com/sczhou/CodeFormer
git clone https://github.com/crowsonkb/k-diffusion
git clone https://github.com/salesforce/BLIP
mv stablediffusion stable-diffusion-stability-ai
cd ..
```


**3. Download Diffusion Models and MLLMs**

In our experiments designed to attain state-of-the-art generative capabilities, we predominantly employ [SDXL](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0),  [SDXL-Turbo](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sdxl-turbo), and [Playground v2](https://huggingface.co/playgroundai/playground-v2-1024px-aesthetic). To generate images of high fidelity across various styles, such as photorealism, cartoons, and anime, we judiciously incorporate certain models from [CIVITA](https://civitai.com/).  For images aspiring to photorealism, we advocate the use of [AlbedoBase XL](https://civitai.com/models/140737/albedobase-xl?modelVersionId=281176) , and [DreamShaper XL](https://civitai.com/models/112902/dreamshaper-xl?modelVersionId=251662). Moreover, we generalized our paradigm to SD v1.5 and SD v2.1 to accommodate a spectrum of requisites. All pertinent checkpoints are accessible within our [Hugging Face spaces](https://huggingface.co/BitStarWalkin/RPG_models), with detailed descriptions found on the accompanying model cards.
Then we need move the downloaded diffusion model weights into the folder **models/Stable-diffusion/**, and please note that the generated images in generated_imgs/.

We recommend the utilization of GPT-4 or Gemini-Pro for users of Multilingual Large Language Models (MLLMs), as they not only exhibit superior performance but also reduce local memory. According to our experiments, the minimum requirements of VRAM is 10GB with GPT-4, if you want to use local LLM, it would need more VRAM. For those interested in using MLLMs locally, we suggest deploying [miniGPT-4](https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/MiniGPT-4) or directly engaging with substantial Local LLMs such as [Llama2-13b-chat](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf) and  [Llama2-70b-chat](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf). 


## Text-to-Image Generation

#### 1. Quick Start

For individuals equipped with constrained computational resources, we here provide a simple notebook demonstration that partitions the image into two equal-sized subregions. By making minor alterations to select functions within the diffusers library, one may achieve commendable outcomes utilizing base diffusion models such as SD v1.4, v1.5, v2.0, and v2.1, as mentioned in our paper. Additionally, you can apply your customized configurations to experiment with a graphics card possessing 8GB of VRAM. For an in-depth exposition, kindly refer to our [Example_Notebook](RegionalDiffusion_playground.ipynb).

#### **2. Demo** 

Note that we have uploaded detailed parameters of some examples in our paper, to make perfect reproduction, the only thing is to download the models we specify in [demo.py](template/demo.py) and run

```
python RPG.py --demo
```

You can find the results in outputs/txt2img-images which caches the generated history, or directly in generated_imgs/demo_imgs/

#### **3. Regional Diffusion with GPT-4**
Our approach can automatically generates output without pre-storing MLLM responses, leveraging Chain-of-Thought reasoning and high-quality in-context examples to obtain satisfactory results. Users only need to understand specific parameters. For example, to use GPT-4 as the planner, we can run:

```bash
--user_prompt 'A handsome young man with blonde curly hair and black suit with a black twintail girl in red cheongsam in the bar.' --model_name 'albedobaseXL_20.safetensors' --version_number 0 --api_key 'put your api key here' --use_gpt --use_base --base_prompt 'a young man and a girl are chatting in the bar' --base_ratio 0.3
```

**--user_prompt** is the original prompt that roughly summarize the content contained in the image

**--model_name** is the name of the model in the directory models/Stable-diffusion/

**--version_number** is the class of our in-context examples used in generation. Our experiments suggest that in various scenarios, by employing proper in-context exemplars as few-shot samples, the planning capabilities of MLLMs can be substantially enhanced. For this case, we aim to synthesize multiple characters bearing multiple attributes. We elect option 0, which is apt for a plan that binds multiple attributes.

**--api_key** is needed if you use GPT-4.

**--use_base**  activate base prompt

**--base_prompt** set base prompt for the image, which is the sketch of the image

**--base_ratio** is the weight of the base prompt

There are also other common optional parameters:

**--cfg** which is the context-free guidance scale

**--steps** the steps to generate an image

**--seed** control the seed to make the generation reproducible

It should be noted that we introduce some important parameters: **--base_prompt & --base_ratio** 

**Q: When should we activate --use_base? And how to set --base_prompt & --base_ratio properly ?**

In our experiments, when you want to generate an image with **multiple entities with the same class** (e.g., two girls, three cats, a man and a girl), you should activate **--use_base** and set base prompt that includes the number of each class of entities in the image using **--base_prompt**. Another relevant parameter is **--base_ratio** which is the weight of the base prompt. According to our experiments, when base_ratio is in [0.25,0.45], the final results are better.  Here is the generated image for command above:

And you will get an image similar to ours results as long as we have the same random seed:

<table class="center">
    <tr>
    <td width=100% style="border: none"><img src="__asset__/demo/FAQs/same_class.png" style="width:100%"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td width="100%" style="border: none; text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word">Text prompt: A handsome young man with blonde curly hair and black suit  with a black twintail girl in red cheongsam in the bar.
</td>
  </tr>
</table>

On the other hand, when it comes to an image including **multiple  entities  with different classes**, there is no need to use base prompt, here is an example:

```bash
python RPG.py --user_prompt 'From left to right, bathed in soft morning light,a cozy nook features a steaming Starbucks latte on a rustic table beside an elegant vase of blooming roses,while a plush ragdoll cat purrs contentedly nearby,its eyes half-closed in blissful serenity.' --model_name 'albedobaseXL_20.safetensors' --version_number 1 --api_key 'put your api key here' --use_gpt
```

  And you will get an image similar to our results:

<table class="center">
    <tr>
    <td width=100% style="border: none"><img src="__asset__/demo/FAQs/different_class.png" style="width:100%"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td width="100%" style="border: none; text-align: center; word-wrap: break-word">Text prompt: From left to right, bathed in soft morning light,a cozy nook features a steaming Starbucks latte on a rustic table beside an elegant vase of blooming roses,while a plush ragdoll cat purrs contentedly nearby,its eyes half-closed in blissful serenity.
</td>
  </tr>
</table>

It's important to know when should we use base_prompt, if these parameters are not set properly, we can not get satisfactory results. We have conducted ablation study about base prompt in our paper, you can check our paper for more information.

#### **4. Regional Diffusion with local LLMs**

We recommend to use base models with over 13 billion parameters for high-quality results, but it will increase load times and graphical memory use at the same time. We have conducted experiments on three different sized models,  Here we take llama2-13b-chat as an example, we can run:

```bash
python RPG.py --user_prompt 'A blonde hair girl with black suit and white skirt' --model_name 'input your model name here' --version_number 0 --use_local --llm_path 'local_llms/llama2-13b-chat' 
```

In local version, we only need to clarify the local llm_path to use llm locally.

**--use_local** activate local llm

**--llm_path** the path to local llms
